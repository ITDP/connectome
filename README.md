A set of scripts for a two-step procedure to measure the value of access to destinations across several modes of travel within a geographic area.

Currently a minimally-functional prototype developed by D. Taylor Reich at the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy

For an explanation of how to set up an instance of these scripts, see [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12Qijv7ExoSFOpH8m0zuUx8hN8Ztzhm2FAvQmMFTbV0w/edit#).
For a sample dataset around Providence, RI, USA, see [this file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RXcxQPaFSVwgFEpawi9p7dtsBqikULBM/view?usp=sharing). For some slides summarizing the concept, see [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mAfsz0u9GiCfs7gGQasz3aLZP22vRoIW/view?usp=sharing).

These scripts rely on R5, developed by Conveyal: https://github.com/conveyal/r5, and on r5r, a wrapper for R5 developed by IPEA: https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/
