# Connectome
A set of scripts for a two-step procedure to measure the value of access to destinations across several modes of travel within a geographic area.

Currently an in-development version by D. Taylor Reich at the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy. Previous git commits include the older, functional but very slow version.

These scripts rely on R5, developed by Conveyal: https://github.com/conveyal/r5, and on r5r, a wrapper for R5 developed by IPEA: https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/, among others
